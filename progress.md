### **âœ… Week 1:**

### ðŸ›  Day 1:Onboarding and Environment Setup

**Environment Chosen:**
- Google Colab (easy setup and runs in browser)

**Installed or Configured:**
- No installations needed with Colab
- Linked Google Drive for file storage

**What I Learned:**
- Basics of Python variables and data types
- How to use lists, tuples, and dictionaries
- Practiced arithmetic and comparison operators
- Used if-else conditions and loops

**Questions:**
- Need more clarity on when to use tuples vs lists
- Want to explore real-world use cases for dictionaries

  


### ðŸ›  Day 2:Python Fundamentals

**Environment Chosen:**

- Google Colab

**Installed:**

- Continued using previous setup

**What I Learned:**

- Writing custom functions (factorial, prime checker)

- How recursion works in Python

- Using built-in modules: math, random, datetime

- try-except-finally for handling runtime errors

- Validating input and preventing crashes

- Solving beginner-level problems (FizzBuzz, reverse string, max finder)

- Practicing Git workflow with commit and push

**Questions:**

- Initially forgot to return base case for recursion in factorial

- Needed to revisit string slicing for reversing

- Forgot to handle ValueError when input is not an integer

**Concepts Practiced:**

- User-defined functions and recursion

- Built-in modules like math, random, datetime

- Exception handling (try, except, finally)

- Problem solving with logic and conditions


**Logic Errors Solved:**

- Fixed a logic error in the prime number loop condition

- Replaced random.random() with random.randint() for integer generation

- Caught ZeroDivisionError with exception handling

- Handled invalid user input using try-except

- Debugged logic in FizzBuzz using modulo conditions

**Easiest vs Hardest:**

- Easiest: Using built-in modules and writing FizzBuzz

- Hardest: Debugging recursive functions, handling input errors, and deep exception tracing
